# Brick-Break-Simulator
Welcome to the OpenGL Brick Break Simulator! This project is built using OpenGL where the player simulates a ball (or many) to break bricks. The bricks are represented as mirrored right triangles, and each brick requires three collisions to break. Balls also disappear upon collision.

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
To build and run this project, you'll need:

- OpenGL: Make sure you have OpenGL installed and configured on your system. <br>
- GLFW: For creating windows and handling input. <br>
- GLM: For matrix operations and transformations <br>

# Controls
- Spacebar: Add a new ball to the simulation

# Future Improvements
- Add an interactive paddle with keyboard controls
- Update collision physics to reduce linear ball trajectory
